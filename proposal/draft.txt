Project: Mapping AI Exposure to Employment: A Data-Driven Study of U.S. Occupations (2014–2024)
Date: December 11, 2025


1. Project Overview
This project examines whether U.S. occupations with higher exposure to generative AI have experienced different labor-market outcomes compared to lower-exposure occupations from 2014 to 2024.

The study uses four main data sources:
- AI exposure scores from the GPTs-are-GPTs research dataset
- Employment and wage data (2014–2024) from the BLS Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)
- Job openings and turnover data from the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)
- Unemployment by education level from the BLS Current Population Survey (CPS)

The core objective is to determine whether AI exposure is associated with differences in employment trends, job openings, and unemployment rates, particularly for white-collar and degree-requiring occupations.


2. Progress Completed So Far
All necessary datasets have been downloaded, organized, and successfully loaded into Python. This includes:

- occ_level.csv (AI exposure scores)
- BLS OEWS employment files for 2014–2024
- BLS JOLTS hiring, separations, and openings data
- BLS CPS unemployment tables parsed from HTML into DataFrames

The data-loading pipeline is set up in Google Colab, and all files load correctly.

3. Work Remaining
The following tasks will be completed for the final submission:

- Finish cleaning all the data sets
- Merge all datasets by SOC occupation codes
- Group occupations into high-, medium-, and low-AI-exposure categories
- Perform trend analysis covering employment levels, unemployment rates, and job openings
- Create visualizations (line plots, bar charts, correlation heatmaps)
- Write full analysis, interpretation, and final conclusion
- Prepare and submit the completed Jupyter Notebook
